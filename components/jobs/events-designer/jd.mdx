[Hack Club](https://hackclub.com) is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit that supports high school coders in starting coding clubs, hackathons, and building awesome projects. Founded in 2014, Hack Club's mission is to support, inspire and motivate teenagers from all backgrounds to become highly-technical, and use their computer skills to solve problems.

Hack Club is a fun, quickly-growing start-up, run by a small team of young, highly-creative engineers, building programs every day for thousands of teenagers from around the world.

Hack Club is looking for an events designer / producer with coding skills to create events for Hack Clubbers.

You'd be our 9th or so full-time staff member. Your role would be to excite and grow the Hack Club online community (16,000 high schoolers on our Slack) by originating, producing, and executing events both online and in-person.

This is not a normal job. We took a train across America to SpaceX with 42 teenagers. We hosted an online chat with Elon Musk. For the last 18 months, a small team has produced a series of online events, and we're excited to hire an incredible, technical person to carry forward and build on these ideas.

** Couple of projects you'll lead on: **
-   Revive Hack Night- the weekly technical hangout with teenagers
-   Produce and project manage the big, crazy projects we do every few months
-   Support Hack Clubbers to create and execute their awesome ideas
-   Support Hack Clubbers to run new technical workshops
-   Lead on producing AMAs and conversations with famous tech leaders
-   Begin to plan our annual summer project
-   Game design events at Hack Club to better help students form meaningful relationships

A good candidate can code, and would have a background in technical education, and have produced events.

** Couple things about you: **
-   You've worked with teenagers before, and organized them
-   You've built and shipped technical projects
-   You have event planning experience, or media production experience
-   You believe in Hack Club values: being technical, kind, curious, optimistic, and helpful
-   You're excited to work 1:1 with high school students every day

In the Hack Club Slack, you'll work with our community to create the best and most inclusive place on the internet for technical teenagers. To work at Hack Club, you need to have a background in programming, but you should be inspired by making things fun.

We are actively looking for candidates who have worked successfully with girl hackers before. We invite and encourage all interested candidates to apply even if they don't feel they meet all of the criteria.

** And a bit more about what we suspect you'll be like: **

You know how to code. When you were a teenager, you were curious about how things worked and enjoyed tinkering with software, art, design, and computers. While you were a teenager you ran a trend-setting Tumblr, ran a business, were in a school club organizing events, created a YouTube channel, helped grow an IRC network, or anything else along the same vein. (but even if you don't think you hit these, please apply anyway!)

You embody the values of a model Hack Clubber: collaborative, kind, high integrity, helpful, and curious. You have the traits of a wonderful friend: always encouraging, genuinely want to see students learn and figure out things on their own, excited to answer questions, and always wanting to help people find their own course of action

** Location: ** We have a strong preference for someone in-person in Burlington, VT, but we will consider applications from people who want to work remotely, provided they are willing to travel to our offices. We have COVID protocols and take them seriously. Relocation assistance available.

** How to apply: ** Email jobs@hackclub.com with "golden" in the subject line, 3 bullet points demonstrating why you would be exceptional for the role, and your resume.

And last, some details on compensation. This role pays between $60K - $100K, depending on your experience---and we know that's probably less than you'd make elsewhere. We offer healthcare and 4 weeks paid vacation.

The mission of Hack Club is to be a place where teenagers can become more technical, feel welcome in getting started, and feel inspired to build with code in ways that are always honest, transparent, high-integrity, kind, and friendly. We want teenagers to self-organize and assert themselves as persons. Already, Hack Club is the largest network of teen coders in the country. We hope for a world where Hack Club becomes a nationwide cultural institution, creating a new generation of young people with the skills, network, and value system to become problem-solvers and builders for the 21st century---a new Boy and Girl Scouts
